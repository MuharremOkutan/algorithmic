[1]: Testing in Algorithmic Trading

Testing is of a profound importance when building algorhtims that will trade with the real money on the real market. Tested should be algorithm, system as a whole as well as every part of it. 
Different approaches can be taken to fullfill that goal, but as a matter of fact every possible approach should be performed. Therefore it's good to have:
- high unit test coverage
- set of manual test cases
- integration tests
- test cases on algorithms with historical data
- test cases with aritificially genereated situations like crashes etc.
- automated tests measuring performance of system as a whole and separately of critical system elemetns

Big parts of these requirements can be met with good, automated testing framework.
